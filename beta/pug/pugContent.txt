Easter in Yerevan, Armenia - Lost With Purpose
Celebrating Easter in Yerevan

How you could spend even less

Eat pastries/fast food for dinner as well. We typically went out to (cheap) restaurants for dinner. Gotta have something that isn’t breaded every once in a while…
Don’t drink so much coffee. We’re kind of addicted to caffeine.
Completely sacrifice your need for quality. Sometimes, there was a marginally cheaper option for sleeping, with terrible reviews. In those cases, we chose the slightly more expensive (but still cheap) option that had good reviews. It was worth it! We had a lot of great times with people/families running guesthouses.

Context/how we roll

We’re your typical wanderin’ backpacker duo:

Always walk or take public transport… unless there is none. (Or we’re reeeally lost…)
Usually eat cheap meals and fast food for at least 2 meals a day
Drink beers every couple of days
Sleep in the cheapest accommodation we can find that isn’t crawling with bedbugs or covered with old vomit. Usually opt for a private double rather than dorms.
We don’t like museums.
